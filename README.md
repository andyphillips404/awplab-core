# AWPLab Core Karaf Library

This is a library for use in Karaf 4 that supports the following:
  1. [iPOJO](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-ipojo.html) native Karaf commands
  2. [Quartz Scheduler](https://quartz-scheduler.org/) with support for multiple schedulers and iPOJO suport
  3. [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) rest server (and client) with multiple aliases
    1.  Jackson support with Jackson JAX-RS providers and data modules
    2.  Test

Currently working on importing the code from other code bases so this repository is under construction until then.
